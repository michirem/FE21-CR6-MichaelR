For this CodeReview, the following criteria were graded:
- Create a GitHub Repository named: FE21-CR6-Name. Push the files into it and send the link through the learning management system (lms). See an example of a GitHub link below:
https://github.com/JohnDoe/repositoryname.git.
- Implement theme design 
- Your project must contain at least 5 components that together should build up your project
- Use routing to move between the pages. E.g.: your navbar contains 3 navigation links: Home, Blog and Travels. When you click Home you should see the content for the homepage. When you click Blog you should see the content for the Blog page and the Travels page will show all travel offers.
- Each travel offer should display the following details: destination, description, start date(s), duration and price.
